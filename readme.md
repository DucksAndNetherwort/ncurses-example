# Starting Point for NCurses Programs

Copied from [https://github.com/tony/ncurses-example](https://github.com/tony/ncurses-example) becaues it had `CMake` setup, was minimal, easy to understand, and drew pretty boxes around the windows ðŸ˜ƒ

## repl.it Notes
- everything below "runner" directory will be removed
- choosing a C++ repl from scratch defaults to the "run" button trying to compile everything
- add a `.replit` file and have run call `cmake`. See [the minimal documentation](https://docs.repl.it/repls/dot-replit) about this feature.
- see   `.replit` for instruction re calling `cmake` manually or modifying the `run` button to call `cmake` every build.
